# Buzzine

> An improved version of my personal Arduino-based alarm clock, made to work on **Raspberry Pi** (especially with Docker environment). Easy to use **REST API** based on **Socket.io** done with a compound **Node.js** core with some doses of **Python**.
> **Multiple alarms, custom sounds, physical LCD support** and **effective waking up with protection** are only a few of many features.

#### Under development

Everything is under development, the app will evolve slowly, step by step. Even the read me file is under construction and will be better :)
